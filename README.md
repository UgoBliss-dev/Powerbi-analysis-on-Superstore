# Powerbi-analysis-on-Superstore
## Introduction:
As part of the Data Analysis class assessment organized by PSP Analytics, I analyzed the Superstore Dataset to evaluate the performance of a superstore located in the United States. The dataset contains shipping dates, sales, profit, and other relevant data.

## Data Sourcing:
The dataset was obtained from the Class announcement channel, posted by Mr. Zion Segun.

## Data Preparation:
The dataset was loaded into Power BI in excel format. Data cleaning and transformation were performed to ensure accuracy.

## Data Exploration and Visualization:
Specific business questions were answered using charts and tiles, including:

- Which Region has the highest sales?
- What is the profit margin for each sub-category?
- In which city does the store have more sales?
- Which segment has more profit?
- Orders by Ship mode?

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
KPIs were defined and calculated using DAX, including sales, quantity, profit, profit margin, and discount.

## Findings:

- The West has the highest sales.
